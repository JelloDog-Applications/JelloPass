# JelloPass

JelloPass is a simple password manager written in Python. It allows users to securely store and retrieve their passwords using encryption. 

JelloPass uses the Fernet encryption method to encrypt passwords, and users can add new passwords, retrieve existing passwords, and get help by typing various commands in the console. The program also checks for updates on a remote repository and prompts the user to update if a new version is available.

## Usage

To use JelloPass, simply download the source code and run `JelloPass.py`. You can add new passwords by typing `add`, retrieve existing passwords by typing `open`, and get help by typing `help`.
